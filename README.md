# Lumy: your quotes' highlighter

Lumy is already on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/lumy-your-quotes-highlighter/id6467809272?l=en-GB)! 

## Description

Have you ever read a book, highlighted a magnificent quote because you really liked it, but then when you finished the book you just forgot it? The time passes by and our memory has a hard time remembering all the quotes, and even where they come from.

So, if you are a book lover and want to keep all those quotes in your heart, Lumy is here for you.

Lumy is the app to keep all those highlights in one place. You just go copy and paste, either in your iPhone, iPad and Mac. Assign a book and a quoter to it. There you go, you have your beautiful shelf of quotes.

But that's not just it.

It will let you remember one different quote everyday, so even when the book is finished, it is always near you. Lumy also provides a widget for you to see your quote of the day everyday. Put it on your main screen and let it remind you.

Also. FORGET about having to write it all down - you can easily add a shortcut with our Siri Intent, so you can add a quote you just read just by asking Siri to do it.
